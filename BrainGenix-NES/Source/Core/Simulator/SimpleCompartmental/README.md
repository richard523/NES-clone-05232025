# SimpleCompartmental

The SimpleCompartmental neuron class and its associated objects exist at a
level of complexity / sophistication between the integrate-and-fire
ball-and-stick neurons and compartmental neuron models with associated
fully specified compartment dynamics.

These neurons still use a simplified model of activation and activity
propagation, but they permit detailed 3D form to better match a realistic
expression for the structural data obtained when imaging tissue containing
neuronal circuits.

Due to the simplification of functional dynamics, these neurons can inherit
many of the member funcitons of the ball-and-stick (BS) neuron class.
