## Inputs

The `Config.cpp` file itself does not directly process inputs. Instead, it relies on its corresponding header file, `Config.h`, which defines the `Config` struct. The data for an instance of the `Config` struct is intended to be populated by an external component (the `ConfigFileParser`, as mentioned in comments within `Config.h`) by reading from a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`).

The `Config` struct has the following members that are set externally:
*   `ConfigFilePaths`: A list of strings representing potential paths to configuration files. Initialized with default paths.
*   `PortNumber`: An integer for the service port number. Initialized with a default value.
*   `Host`: A string for the host the service binds to. Initialized with a default value.
*   `ProfilingStatus_`: An enum of type `ProfilingStatus` to set preconfigured profiling characteristics. Initialized to `PROFILE_NONE`.
*   `MaxVoxelArraySize_`: An integer to set the maximum size of each voxel array.
*   `VoxelArrayPercentOfSystemMemory_`: A float to set the percentage of system memory allowed for voxel arrays.

## Outputs

The `Config.cpp` file, through `Config.h`, primarily provides the definition for the `Config` struct. When an instance of this struct is created and populated (externally), its members serve as outputs that can be accessed by other parts of the application to retrieve configuration settings. There are no methods that return values or write to files defined directly within these files.

## Description

The `Config.cpp` file, by including `Config.h`, provides the definitions necessary for managing application configuration. `Config.h` defines the `Config` struct, which is a container for various configuration parameters (like network settings and memory limits) loaded from an external source. It also defines the `ProfilingStatus` enum used to specify different profiling modes for the application. Essentially, these files define the schema for application configuration data.

## ASCII Diagram

The primary component defined is the `Config` struct. As it's a data structure without methods, the diagram reflects its members.
