## Inputs

This file does not define executable code that processes inputs. Its corresponding header, `RouteAndHandler.h`, defines the `RouteAndHandler` struct.

An instance of `RouteAndHandler` is populated with:
*   `Route_` (std::string): The textual identifier for an RPC route.
*   `Handler_` (std::function<std::string>&): A reference to the function that will handle requests for this route.

## Outputs

This module primarily provides a data structure. The "output" is the `RouteAndHandler` struct itself, which is used by other parts of the RPC system to associate routes with their implementing functions.

## Description

The `RouteAndHandler.h` file defines a simple struct, `RouteAndHandler`, used within the BrainGenix-NES RPC system. This struct serves to link an RPC route (identified by a string) with the specific function responsible for handling requests to that route.
