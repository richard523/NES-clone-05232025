- Neuroglancer integration: switch from restbed to better framework
- VDSA should use HandleData functions.
- Remove duplicate functions, use templates where that helps.
- Flatten the calcium structs.
- Fewer namespaces, avoid nested namespaces.
- Properly isolate unrelated code.
- All structs should have identifiable default values to simplify knowing if they were not given actual values.
- Once asserts are removed in the release build we need to make sure that parameters are actually tested once as they come in through the interface
- Progress bars should crash or exit if the backend has crashed.
- Errors should send back error messages, can't expect people to be able to see NES command line window.
- Comments that should show up in doxygen need to be in the .h.
- Revert GeometryCollection to a dumb list, preferably without static casts
- Remove OOP junk
